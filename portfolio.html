            <h2>Flappy Bird Mobile Clone (2025)</h2>
            <p>
                For this I focused on taking a project I had already done and converting it to work for mobile. While this wasn't the biggest thing I could create it helped provide me experience in mobile game development. (Assets are from the GMTK unity tutorial as I used that previously however I did not use the video to make the game.)<br>

            <h2>Have played a decent amount of Bitburner</h2>
            <p>
                Bitburner is a videogame where the main way of progressing is writing javascript scripts. While I (obviously) haven't made the game I have played a decent amount of it and it has helped progress my javascript skills. 
                <a href="https://github.com/JustAPhox/BitburnerScripts">So uh Github for my scripts here.</a> They work and automate a decent amount of stuff.<BR>
