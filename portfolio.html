            <h2>Fake Game</h2>
            <p>
                This is just a fake game so I can spread this out slightly. More Stuff will be added later when I find something that should be here

            <h2>Find a way to show Bitburner Progress</h2>
            <p>
                Like the amount I've played Bitburner def does show how much I've learnt with programming but I can't just add "I played a video game" to a portfolio
